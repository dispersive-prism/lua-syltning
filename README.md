# lua-syltning
Currently just a (too and very) verbose sandbox where I play around to build the different stages of a 2d platformer. Code is not optimized, there might be bugs etc. etc.

## Verified Löve2d versions
I started out with Löve 11.1, but have recently switched to 11.2. I had to do some changes to the basic physics when upping the versions. So, my recommendation to get this somewhat buggy stuff working is to use *LOVE 11.2 (Mysterious Mysteries). At least that is the version I'm currently playing around with.
